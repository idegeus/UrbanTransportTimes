# Shapefiles

Github does not support the inclusion of files larger than 100mb in repositories. Before, the shapefiles were here. Right now, they are released as a full-on binary release: see [it's proper page](https://github.com/idegeus/UrbanTransportTimes/releases/) to get the latest version of the shapefile.
